<h2 id="core-values" class="heading-2">3. Our Values</h2>
<p>At its core, The Polyfen Group is founded on —not business values, but— human values.</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
    <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;"><strong>Transparency:</strong> Honesty is the best policy. We are straightforward, and we communicate clearly and with candour. For the most part, all team-members have access to our “best guarded” research and strategy documents. We even chose to make some of our internal documents publicly available online for free.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;"><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Everyone in the team has a voice. Everyone can suggest improvements in any area. Everyone has all the doors wide open to become an integral member of the business and be rewarded accordingly. Everyone in the team can be given the opportunity to become a partner and part-owner of our business if they generate enough value.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;"><strong>Initiative:</strong> We seek to maintain a dedicated and proactive role in each and every project. There are many problems to solve in the world; Whether at a micro or macro scale, it’s up to us to decide to stand up and do something about it. If there’s anything that we can do better, as a part of this team, you have been untrusted with the responsibility to speak out and suggest a solution.</li>
</ul>
