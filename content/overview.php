  <h2 id="overview" class="heading-1">1. Overview</h2>
  <p>The Polyfen Group LLC is a small holding company that owns and operates a portfolio of brands with the common goal to explore new ways of using technology in creative projects.</p>
  <p>The company was founded in 2018 by <a href="https://boris.hr" target="_blank">Boris Hrn&ccaron;i&cacute;</a> &mdash;Argentinian-Croatian, art director and product designer&mdash; with the support of a few colleagues sharing the same passion for building something we can be proud of.</p>
  <p>The stock is 100% independently owned by the team with no dependency on investors or any other kind of external funding.</p>
  <p>Our location-independent business model takes advantage of the latest advancements in technology to work seamlessly with a fully-remote team years before the Covid pandemic made it the new normal.</p>
